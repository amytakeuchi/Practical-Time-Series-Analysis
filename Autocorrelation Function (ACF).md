# Autocorrelation Function (ACF)
The autocorrelation function measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values. It is a normalized version of the autocovariance function and takes values between -1 and 1.
<br /> 
The autocorrelation coefficient between $X_t$ and $X_{t+k}$ is denoted by $ρ_k$ and is defined as:<br /> 
$ρ_k = γ_k / γ_0$
