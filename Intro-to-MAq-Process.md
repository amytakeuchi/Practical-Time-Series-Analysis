## MA(q) model 
An MA(q) model is defined as a linear combination of the current white noise term and q past white noise terms. The general form of an MA(q) model is:
<br /> 
<br /> 
$Xt = μ + εt + θ1εt-1 + θ2εt-2 + ... + θqεt-q$
<br /> 
Where
- $Xt$ is the value of the time series at time t
- $μ$ is the mean of the series
- $εt, εt-1, ..., εt-q$ are white noise error terms
- $θ1, θ2, ..., θq$ are the parameters of the model
