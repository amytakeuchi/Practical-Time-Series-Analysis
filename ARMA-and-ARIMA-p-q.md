ARMA stands for AutoRegressive Moving Average. It's a model that combines two components: 
- AR(p): AutoRegressive component of order p
- MA(q): Moving Average component of order q

AR(p) Component:
- p is the order of the autoregressive term
- It models the dependency between an observation and a certain number (p) of lagged observations

MA(q) Component:
- q is the order of the moving average term
- It models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations
