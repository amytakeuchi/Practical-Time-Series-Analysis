# Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Model Quality

## What is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)?
AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. It estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model.
