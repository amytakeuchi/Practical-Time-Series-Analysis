# Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Model Quality

## What is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)?
AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. It estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model: the less information a model loses, the higher the quality of that model. <br /> 

## How is AIC used in time series analysis?
In time series analysis, AIC is primarily used for:  <br /> 
  a) Selecting the optimal order of ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models
  b) Comparing different models (e.g., AR vs MA vs ARMA)
  c) Balancing model complexity with goodness of fit
The model with the lowest AIC is generally preferred.  <br />
