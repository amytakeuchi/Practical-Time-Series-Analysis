# White Noise
## What is White Noise?
White noise is a random signal that has equal intensity at different frequencies, giving it a constant power spectral density. In simpler terms, it's a sequence of: <br /> 
- uncorrelated random variables with
- zero mean and
- constant variance.

### Formula for White Noise
The mathematical model for white noise can be expressed as: <br /> 
<br /> 
      $X_t = ε_t$
<br /> 
<br /> 
Where:
- $X_t$ is the white noise process at time t
- $ε_t$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with:
